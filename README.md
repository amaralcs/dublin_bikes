# dublin_bikes
Final year project for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
The goal of the project is to analyse usage of the Dublin Bikes, try to identify patterns of usage and proceed towards an estimation of the adequate number of bikes available in each station at a given period of time.

## Data source
Data was acquired from a server in Maynooth University which scrapes the JCDecaux API every 5 minutes. The API can be publicly accessed and documentation is availble on https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/home.

## Tools used
R and Rstudio are the main tools used for this project, using a variety of packages available for reading data, parsing it and plotting.
